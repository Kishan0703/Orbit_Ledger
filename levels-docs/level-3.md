# 🟠 Level 3 — Orange Belt

## Overview

Level 3 takes Orbit Ledger from a functional multi-signature dApp to a more release-ready Testnet experience. This stage focuses on smoother wallet behavior, stronger feedback during transactions, performance improvements, and testing.

The app now includes step-based loading states, short-lived balance caching, automatic refresh handling, live fiat values in USD and INR, safer wallet switching, clearer error messages, and coverage for frontend utility logic plus smart contract behavior.

The project is publicly deployed and fully functional on Testnet.

## 🟠 Level 3 Enhancements

### 1. Structured Loading States

All async actions (Create, Approve, Execute) now display clear step-based progress messages. The UI prevents duplicate actions while transactions are processing.

### 2. Balance Caching (30s TTL)

Balances are cached in memory for 30 seconds to reduce redundant Horizon calls and improve performance. After expiration, fresh data is automatically fetched.

### 3. Auto-Refresh

Balance refreshes silently every 30 seconds to ensure users always see updated on-chain data.

### 4. Wallet Switch Fix

Resolved stale balance issue during wallet switching. Balance resets instantly and re-fetches for the new address, preventing misleading data.

### 5. Live USD & INR Value Display

The dashboard shows:

- Current XLM rate
- Total wallet value in USD
- Total wallet value in INR

This provides real-world context for on-chain balances.

### 6. Improved Error Handling

Smart contract error codes are mapped to clear user-friendly messages:

- Proposal not found
- Already executed
- More approvals required
- Invalid address or amount
- Already approved

Network and wallet errors are also handled consistently.
